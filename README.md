WildBeast is build as a framework for multi-purpose Discord bots, being both super customisable and easy to use.

========

# Installation
Installing WildBeast is easy, **easier if you decide to use [Vagrant.](https://github.com/SteamingMutt/WildBeast/wiki/Vagrant)**   
First, you're required to install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org), WildBeast is build run on Node.js version 5.x.x so install a 5.x.x version  
Next up, FFMPEG, installing this will be documented in the [wiki.](https://github.com/SteamingMutt/WildBeast/wiki/Music#FFMPEG)   
When that's all installed, now is a great time to make your config.json file, if you haven't already. An example is included within this repo.   
When you're done making the config.json file, you now need to open a command propt in the folder you've extracted the files to. (Hold shift and right-click to quickly open a command propt in a folder.)   
Now you need to install the NPM modules [(sidenote)](https://github.com/SteamingMutt/WildBeast/wiki/Music#Node-opus), just run `npm install` in the command prompt you've just opened and all of the required modules will be installed.   
When the modules have been installed, run `node DougBot.js` in the command prompt you've opened and the bot will try to connect to Discord, after this, the bot is fully operational!

# Development
We (the devs) host a deployed version of WildBeast called WildBot over on [Discord](https://discord.gg/0cFoiR5QVh4agupi), feel free to use that one if you're not keen on the hassle of hosting your own instance.
